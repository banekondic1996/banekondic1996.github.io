Now as everyone uses\n  Chromium, almost</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">no browsers have at least option to extend that period of history\n  retention.</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">Many times i wanted to find something i couldn't, sometimes even some stuff\n  disappeared</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">from my history, not to mention lost sessions even using Session Buddy\n  extension.</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">One update, one restart, whole Chrome session with 40+ tabs can be\n  gone.&nbsp;</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">For those reasons I<span style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">&nbsp;download my\n    tabs into html file everyday.&nbsp;</span></div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">Now for history part, i managed to mod Chromium by finding\n  number&nbsp;<span style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">90&nbsp;</span><span\n    style=\"font-size: 1.0625rem;\">and it's function and</span></div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">increased to 9999, but i haven't built it, it takes hours to build\n  Chromium.</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">Someone says these are reasons for 90 day limitation:<br>\n  <pre><code>Absolutely no need to have a long history. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>Seriously, why would you need to know what websites you visited a year ago? </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>Typically if it was important or useful it would be bookmarked. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>And it can be a lot to even try to sort through. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>But for those who think it’s important, </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>you can get extensions that help track. (or on Chrome, you can just save it to your Google account overall)\nTo improve overall performance. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>The more items in your local history, the slower your browser can become when it tries to access or index that data (e.g., auto-complete suggestions in the address bar).\nTo reduce used space rather than clogging up people’s devices. By limiting how much local data is stored, browsers reduce overall storage footprints.\nTo reduce potential issues around privacy and security. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>If an attacker gains physical or remote access to your device, a massive, never-ending browser history could be a treasure trove of personal data. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>Restricting local history to a shorter time window reduces this risk.\nTo step away from potential issues with regulatory guidelines. GDPR, LGPD, CCPA/CPRA, PIPEDA, AAPI, </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>and other such regulations by governments state that personal data should not be held onto longer than necessary. </code></pre>\n  <pre><code>It also aligns broadly with the concept of “Privacy by Design” embedded in regulations like GDPR.</code></pre>\n  I completly don't agree with this person. I do need long history, many times\n  someone asked me something i saw months ago somewhere, and I cant find, cause\n  it's gone! So f' this person.<br>So as i used Better History chrome extension,\n  i decided to make own version, and I was like, let's try to make\n</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">it store more then 90days. So I did make it, didn't test it still completly\n  though.</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">Except extended history, which how i called extension, there's option to\n  see time spent on websites, bookmarks,</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">recent history popup via extension button, activity per day, export/import\n  bookmarks and history, search by date.</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">So you would expect Google to make good history manager in Chromium, but\n  yet you can't even search by date.<br>Firefox is even worse, it's like using\n  Internet Explorer styled history, but at least you can sort by some dates.\n</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">As for Google, even Google Analytics lacks basic function as filtering web\n  traffic data based on region</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">So this is is extension that i made, well vibe coded.... It took sometime\n  anyway.</div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\">Overall, will be using it personally now, and I'm happy with it.<br><a\n    href=\"https://github.com/banekondic1996/Extended-History---Chrome\">Link to\n    extension</a><br><img\n    src=\"https://private-user-images.githubusercontent.com/22860264/552376021-2d4a3445-28cb-40f6-9343-7237dee172dc.png?jwt=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.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.NUfzlt2fCvmCPqLPwky6Fz1dQZl6P0M-O5Epw_M5ZQg\"\n    alt=\"Image\" style=\"max-width: 100%;\"><br></div>\n<div style=\"word-break: break-word;\"><br></div>"
