Razer Ornata is my favorite that uses Mecha-Membrane Switches, type of hybrid feel between membrane one and mechanical one. But still it's not low profile that much. What i want is low profile flat keys keyboard that has totally transparent or translucent keys, but also option for RGB, with that type of feel that's hybrid between mechanical and membrane. Yet not single flat key keyboard with transparent keys on market exists... So what? I need to make it myself or what?</span><span class=\"\" style=\"box-sizing: inherit; border-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9); border-style: none; border-width: 0px; border-image: none 100% / 1 / 0 stretch; font-size: 14px; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: none; background-position: 0% 0%; background-size: auto; background-repeat: repeat; background-attachment: scroll; background-origin: padding-box; background-clip: border-box; outline: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9) none 0px;  color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);  line-height: inherit !important;\"> </span><span style=\"color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.9);  font-size: 14px;\">Btw.
