And when I'm near someone i just press the watch, get 3 strongest signals and bam, I got their phone number. And if paired with Meta glasses and national database, cause every number is registered on the name, then I would be able to see peoples names using those AR glasses. And Meta Glasses should have standard 10x zoom camera, so you can actually see in far when needed</span>"
