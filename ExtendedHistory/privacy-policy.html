                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Extended History ("we," "our," or "the extension") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how Extended History handles your data when you use our Chrome browser extension.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Our Core Privacy Principle:</strong> Extended History is designed with privacy as a fundamental priority. All data collected by the extension remains on your local device. We do not collect, transmit, store, or have access to any of your browsing data.</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect and Process</h2>
                
                <h3>1.1 Data Collected Locally on Your Device</h3>
                <p>Extended History collects and stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's local storage API:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Browsing History:</strong> URLs, page titles, visit timestamps, and domain names of websites you visit</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Tracking Data:</strong> Amount of time spent on each website, organized by domain and date</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Data:</strong> Information about your open tabs, including URLs and titles, to enable session saving and restoration</li>
                    <li><strong>Bookmarks:</strong> Access to your Chrome bookmarks for viewing, organizing, and exporting within the extension</li>
                    <li><strong>User Preferences:</strong> Your chosen settings such as theme (dark/light mode), accent colors, retention period, font preferences, and auto-save intervals</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistics:</strong> Aggregated data such as total page loads per domain, daily activity metrics, and storage usage</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1.2 Data We Do NOT Collect</h3>
                <p>Extended History does NOT collect, access, or process:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)</li>
                    <li>Payment or financial information</li>
                    <li>Passwords or login credentials</li>
                    <li>Form data or autofill information</li>
                    <li>Content of web pages you visit</li>
                    <li>Cookies from websites</li>
                    <li>Browsing data from incognito/private mode</li>
                    <li>Analytics or telemetry data</li>
                    <li>Device information beyond what Chrome APIs provide for functionality</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>2. How We Use Your Data</h2>
                
                <h3>2.1 Purpose of Data Collection</h3>
                <p>All data collected by Extended History is used exclusively on your local device for the following purposes:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>History Management:</strong> To display, search, filter, and organize your browsing history with unlimited retention (configurable from 30 to 3650 days)</li>
                    <li><strong>Time Tracking:</strong> To calculate and display how much time you spend on different websites</li>
                    <li><strong>Session Management:</strong> To save your current tab configuration and restore previous sessions</li>
                    <li><strong>Bookmarks Management:</strong> To provide an enhanced interface for viewing and organizing your Chrome bookmarks</li>
                    <li><strong>Statistics & Insights:</strong> To show you patterns in your browsing behavior, such as most-visited sites and daily activity</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Portability:</strong> To enable you to export your history, bookmarks, and time tracking data as JSON files</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2.2 Local Processing Only</h3>
                <p>All data processing occurs entirely on your local device. There are no remote servers, cloud services, or external APIs involved in the core functionality of Extended History.</p>

                <h2>3. Data Storage and Security</h2>
                
                <h3>3.1 Storage Location</h3>
                <p>All data is stored using Chrome's <code>chrome.storage.local</code> API, which stores data locally on your device. This storage is:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Isolated to the Extended History extension</li>
                    <li>Not accessible by websites or other extensions</li>
                    <li>Not synced to Google's servers (Chrome Sync is not used by this extension)</li>
                    <li>Encrypted at rest by your operating system's standard encryption mechanisms</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.2 Data Security</h3>
                <p>While Extended History does not transmit data externally, we follow these security practices:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>We use Chrome's secure APIs designed for extension development</li>
                    <li>We do not inject any third-party scripts or libraries from external sources</li>
                    <li>We implement input validation to prevent potential security issues</li>
                    <li>All data access is restricted to the extension's isolated environment</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3.3 Data Retention</h3>
                <p>Extended History stores your browsing history according to your configured retention period (default: 3650 days / 10 years). You can:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Adjust the retention period in Settings from 30 days to 3650 days</li>
                    <li>Delete specific history entries at any time</li>
                    <li>Delete history by date range or based on filters</li>
                    <li>Clear all history with a single action</li>
                    <li>Uninstall the extension to permanently delete all stored data</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>4. Data Sharing and Third Parties</h2>
                
                <h3>4.1 No Data Sharing</h3>
                <p><strong>Extended History does not share, sell, rent, or transmit any of your data to third parties.</strong></p>
                
                <h3>4.2 Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>The extension uses the following external resources for non-data-transmitting purposes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Google Favicon Service:</strong> When displaying website icons, the extension loads favicons from <code>https://www.google.com/s2/favicons</code>. This is a standard, publicly available service that only receives domain names (e.g., "example.com") to retrieve icons. No personal data or complete browsing history is transmitted.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>No analytics services, tracking scripts, or advertising networks are used.</p>

                <h3>4.3 Chrome Sync (Optional)</h3>
                <p>Extended History does NOT use Chrome Sync to synchronize your history across devices. If you enable Chrome's built-in device sync feature, you may see browsing history from other devices through Chrome's native <code>chrome.sessions.getDevices()</code> API, but this data is provided by Chrome itself, not transmitted by Extended History.</p>

                <h2>5. Chrome Permissions Explanation</h2>
                
                <p>Extended History requests the following Chrome permissions. Each permission is used exclusively for its stated purpose:</p>

                <table class="permissions-table">

                <h2>9. International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Since Extended History stores all data locally on your device and does not transmit data to any servers, there are no international data transfers. Your data remains on your device, wherever you are located.</p>

                <h2>10. Updates to This Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the extension or legal requirements. When we make changes:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy will be revised</li>
                    <li>Significant changes will be communicated through the extension or on this website</li>
                    <li>Continued use of the extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>11. Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h2>
                <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), the legal basis for processing your data is:</p>
